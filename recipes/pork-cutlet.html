  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Serve these crispy pork cutlets with my delicious cream gravy that's flavored with pickles, jalapeño pepper,
    and green onions. You can substitute veal, beef, turkey, or chicken for the pork without missing a beat.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>2 (1 1/4 pound) fully trimmed pork tenderloins, cut into 8 pieces</li>
    <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or as needed</li>
    <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
    <li>3 cups panko bread crumbs</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
    <li>⅓ cup diced dill pickles</li>
    <li>1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced</li>
    <li>1 bunch green onions, chopped, green tops reserved</li>
    <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
    <li>1 ½ tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 ½ cups cold milk, or more as needed</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce, or to taste</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or more to taste</li>
    <li>½ cup vegetable oil for frying</li>
    <li>salt to taste</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Place pork pieces between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid,
       level surface. Firmly pound pork with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/2 inch.</li>
    <li>Transfer pork pieces to a plate and season both sides generously with salt and black pepper;
       sprinkle with 2 tablespoons of flour, lightly coating both sides. Pour eggs over pork, turning to coat.</li>
    <li>Place panko in a shallow bowl; place pork pieces in panko, pressing firmly to coat on both sides.
       Transfer breaded cutlets to a clean plate, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 15 minutes.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in pickles, jalapeño pepper,
       and green onions; cook and stir until onions have softened, about 3 minutes. Sprinkle in 1 1/2 tablespoons
        flour; cook and stir for 3 minutes.</li>
    <li>Slowly stir in 2 to 3 tablespoons cold milk, whisking constantly. Stir in remaining milk, 
      Worcestershire sauce, and black pepper. Simmer on low for 5 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning;
       set sauce aside.</li>
    <li>Heat 1/4 cup vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add 1/2 of the breaded pork cutlets
       and cook until pork is no longer pink inside, and the crust is well-browned, 4 to 5 minutes per side.
        Transfer to plate lined with paper towels. Sprinkle with salt. Repeat with remaining vegetable oil
         and pork cutlets.</li>
    <li>Serve cutlets topped with sauce.</li>
  </ol>
